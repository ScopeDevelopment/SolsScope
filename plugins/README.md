# Plugins
## To install a plugin, open the macro and click on the "Other" tab. Press install plugin and then find the Python file with the code. You will see a message box saying the plugin was installed.
## Make sure that the code inside [`template.py`](https://github.com/bazthedev/SolsRNGBot/blob/main/plugins/template.py) is used before starting your plugin.
## These allow the code to access the global configuration and the plugin's own configuration.
## For an example of starting a plugin, please look at [`template.py`](https://github.com/bazthedev/SolsRNGBot/blob/main/plugins/template.py).
## Your plugin's logic will be executed in the run function.
## To publish a plugin to this repo, you must reach out to me and send the code in a .txt format, where it will be reviewed before being added.
## All plugins should require version 1.2.3 or later, as the plugin optimisations take place in this version onwards.
